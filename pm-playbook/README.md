## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ashstep2/pm-playbook.git
cd pm-playbook
# Open in Claude Code and invoke any skill by name
```

No configuration required. Skills work out of the box by asking for context interactively. Add a `context/` directory to ground outputs in your company's data.

## Why This Is Different

| | Generic prompts | Consulting frameworks | **pm-playbook** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Structured output** | Free-form text | PDF decks | Markdown artifacts with sections, tables, scorecards |
| **Attributed principles** | "Best practice says..." | Proprietary IP | Named sources with direct quotes and URLs |
| **Context-aware** | Starts from zero | Manual input | Reads `context/` directory, fills gaps conversationally |
| **Composable** | One-shot | Siloed engagements | Skills chain via `skill-graph.yaml` |
| **Evolving** | Static | Annual updates | `/learn` ingests new content, `/improve` reflects on runs |
| **Signal-fed** | No live data | Expensive research | Auto-collects from GitHub, HN, Reddit, news APIs |

## Skill Dependency Graph

Skills feed into each other. After completing a skill, the system suggests what to run next based on [`skill-graph.yaml`](skill-graph.yaml).

## Installation

### Path A: Zero-Config (30 seconds)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ashstep2/pm-playbook.git
# Open in Claude Code → invoke any skill by name
```

Skills ask for context interactively. No setup required.

### Path B: Project Integration (5 minutes)

```bash
# From your project root
git submodule add https://github.com/ashstep2/pm-playbook.git
bash pm-playbook/scaffold/install.sh
```

This symlinks all 19 skills into `.claude/skills/` and generates a `CLAUDE.md` for your project.

### Path C: Full Company Setup (30 minutes)

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/ashstep2/pm-playbook.git
bash pm-playbook/scaffold/install.sh

# Fill in company context
mkdir -p context/{company,competitive,products,verticals,founders,signals}
# Add markdown files to each directory (see scaffold/ for templates)

# Set up signal collectors (optional)
cp pm-playbook/signals.yaml.example signals.yaml
# Edit signals.yaml, add API keys to .env
pip install pyyaml requests PyGithub praw
cd pm-playbook && python3 -m collectors.run --config ../signals.yaml
```

### Graceful Degradation

Skills work at every level — more context produces more grounded output, but nothing breaks without it.

| Setup Level | Behavior |
|---|---|
| No `context/` | Skills ask for information interactively |
| Partial `context/` | Use what's available, ask for the rest |
| Full `context/` + signals | Fully grounded, no questions needed |

## Self-Improvement

Two meta-skills in `_meta/` help the system evolve:

- **`/learn`** — Ingest an article, podcast transcript, or book excerpt. Extracts insights, filters for novelty, and writes improvement proposals to `_meta/proposals/` for human review. Proposals are never auto-applied.
- **`/improve`** — Run after any skill to score its effectiveness (Instruction Clarity, Context Sufficiency, Artifact Usefulness) and propose one concrete improvement. Reflections accumulate in `applied/_reflections.md` and surface recurring patterns.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for how proposals become PRs.

## Signal Collectors

The `collectors/` framework auto-collects public data into `context/signals/`.

| Collector | Auth Required | What It Collects |
|---|---|---|
| `hackernews` | None | HN stories matching configured keywords |
| `github` | `GITHUB_TOKEN` | Repo stars, forks, issues, PRs for tracked repos |
| `reddit` | `REDDIT_CLIENT_ID` + `REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET` | Posts from configured subreddits |
| `news` | `NEWS_API_KEY` | Articles from NewsAPI |

```bash
cd pm-playbook && python3 -m collectors.run --config ../signals.yaml
```

Config lives in `signals.yaml` at your repo root. See `signals.yaml.example` for format.

## Skill Format

Each skill follows the [Anthropic Agent Skills spec](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview). See [SKILL_FORMAT.md](SKILL_FORMAT.md) for the full reference. Skills include:

- **Core Principles** — attributed insights with direct quotes and source URLs
- **Instructions** — step-by-step workflow producing concrete artifacts
- **Diagnostic Questions** — assess the situation before diving in
- **Common Mistakes** — what PMs get wrong and how to avoid it
- **Context Integration** — how the skill uses company data
